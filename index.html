  <div id="greeting"> Hi, I'm Lindy! </div>
  <span id="bio"> A sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science.
    During my free time, you can find me coding, designing, or journaling! </span>
  <span id="scroll"> (scroll down to learn more about me!) </span>
  <span id="intro">I grew up in a small town in Illinois for the majority of my life
    before pursuing my love of science and technology at the Illinois Mathematics
    and Science Academy. It was here where I was first introduced to computer science.
    After high school, I moved to Berkeley, to continue
    my education. I've become really interested in the intersection between
    design, technology, and user experience. I love dissecting problems and finding
    ways to create a better user experience.
